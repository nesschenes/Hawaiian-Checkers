## About
**GameManager** is the core of Gameplay, such as generation of the pieces, controling state of the pieces and the boards.

**GameStepPipeline** controls the whole game life time, such as GameBegin, GameOver...

The each **Board** is generated by random uv, so that you can see its texture seems different with the others.

It supports **any square size** of the checkerboard.

## How to start
You can start from **Initialize** scene to enjoy the game with complete pipeline,
or just start from **Game** scene to play the game directly.

## How to play
You can play it on PC or mobile(apk, ipa) platforms as well(just click it!).
I'm not good at this game. smile~ (>.<)

## Future plan
1. Use row and column respectively instead of **BoardRowsCount**.
2. Implement the gameplay with 9 * 13 or any irregular size of checkerboard.
3. Add sound effect.
4. Add **Tutorial** mode.
5. Implement the **AI** to support **Single Player** mode.
